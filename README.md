# 🏔️ Chakaluwa: The 100-Year Life Protocol

**Chakaluwa** is a mindful life-operating system designed for the long-term developer. Set against the atmospheric backdrop of **Nainital, India**, it integrates high-level software engineering with the grounding reality of organic farming and physical vitality.

This isn't a game of "levels" that reset; it is a permanent record of **Continuous Growth**.

## 🧘 The Philosophy

Modern productivity often leads to burnout through fragmented attention. **Chakaluwa** operates on three core pillars:

1. **The 100-Year Path:** Your Coding and Farming Wisdom are cumulative. They represent a lifetime of skill-building that never expires.
2. **The Attention Economy:** It distinguishes between *Growth Learning* (Deep Work) and *Useless Distractions* (Short-form content), visualizing the "Digital Fog" that accumulates when focus is lost.
3. **Organic Reset:** It recognizes that the antidote to "Digital Fog" isn't more technology—it's nature, yoga, and sleep.

## 🛠️ Core Features

### 💻 The Execution Engine (Mindful Terminal)

Located at the base of the dashboard, the terminal is your workstation.

* **Mindful Push:** Execute coding tasks to earn Credits and Wisdom.
* **Fog Constraint:** If your "Digital Fog" exceeds 70%, the terminal locks, forcing a mandatory mental reset through gardening or yoga.

### 🌿 Backyard Orchard & Farm

Your connection to the earth is your primary battery.

* **Morning Ritual:** Watering plants clears 40% of Digital Fog instantly.
* **Weekend Farm Day:** Intense physical labor on the land to maximize Vitality and Farming Wisdom.

### 🌫️ Digital Fog & Harmony Pillars

Real-time tracking of your current state:

* **Mind (Creativity):** Fuelled by deep work and quality learning.
* **Body (Vitality):** Restored by farm work and sound sleep.
* **Soul (Connection):** Maintained through family time and grounding rituals.
* **Fog (Dopamine Load):** Increased by social media scrolling; decreased by nature and deep study.
